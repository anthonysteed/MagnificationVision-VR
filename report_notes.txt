# Primary evolution

* How to do magnification/zoom?
* Moving camera back and forth?
	* No, that was shitty
* Adjusting FOV?
	* Yes, but this was fiddly (there was a small window of viable zoom -- going above or below that level was insane)
* Deep-dive into optics of magnifying glasses
* Created natural hand-based magnification based on natural equations
* Attempted to do eye-based magnification -- this required detour into geometry
	* Find Gaze-Rect intersection, then rect-object intersection
	* Very fiddly at first, and experimented with finding ways to aggregate gaze data over time (single-frame eye movements are not accurate)
	* Extremely difficult to debug: Cannot look at debug text without altering behaviour
	* Settled on a variation on 
* Implemented traditional hand-based teleportation, but realised it distracted from the main task
* So, created a gaze-based teleportation system
	* Details on adjusting for colliders + penetration vectors
	* Follow dot, and mark teleport destination with TeleportMarker
	* Tried having zoom effect to show transition to new location, but this induced motion sickness (in me, anyway)
* Logging system



## Extra tweaks
* To synchronise the current zoom level with the item the user is actually targeting (when looking around normally), we also buffer gaze-ray intersections in a similar moving-average way all the time, so that the moment the user looks at the Rect the zoom distance is calibrated to what they were looking at before zooming began
* This technique relies heavily on Unity collision system (everything needs to have a collider that matches its physical shape for ray intersections to work), and gaze targets cannot be occluded by other colliders
	* So, in this setup, careful structuring of scene was required
