# TO-DO:

* extra zoom effect on gaze teleport?
* lower gaze dot alpha when very close
* adjust "seen" algorithm + surrounding colliders for hidden items
	
	
* prepare scene:
	* ensure all objects have colliders
	* 
	
	
	
## THINGS TO LOG:
* whether object was found though magRect or with direct unaided gaze
