Aim for total 18 experiments! (12 minimum)

# Process:
* Before experiment, let subject read info sheet in lobby
* Upon 6.12 entry, give them consent form to fill out
* Tell them they are free to leave whenever they like
* After signing, give them explanation of what they'll be doing ("you'll be in a virtual world, you can control zoom/dot with your eyes, etc.")
* Put on headset/controllers, do eye calibration
* Run game (PERM_1, technique x) with tutorial
* When complete, perform quick questionaire
* Put on headset, do calibration
* Run game (PERM_2, technique y) without turial
* When complete, perform quick questionaire
* Put on headset, do calibration
* Run game (PERM_3, technique y) without turial
* When complete, do complete post-experiment questionaire
* Give them Â£10

# Experiment order (decided)
* Always play PERM_1 -> PERM_2 -> PERM_3 in that order
* Keep a list of last used technique order, and pick a new order each time
	* e.g. GAZE-COMBINED-NONE, GAZE-NONE-COMBINED, COMBINED-GAZE-NONE, etc.
	
	
# TO-DO
* Write script of what to say and when (to introduce task and technique)
* Add sound effects? (Game start, game complete, door creak, door slam)
* Get poster text/template and get it ready for print (don't mention eye tracking)
* Get questionaire template + add custom stuff (ask about VR+gaming experience)
* Research "system causality questionaire" (SUS)
