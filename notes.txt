# TO-DO:

* adjust mag. distance average to weigh more recent samples less? (to slow down convergence to point far away)
* augment mag camera rotation with gaze rotation (play around with how much)
* teleportation to dot position with button click/hold

* stretch: activate mag glass only if hands align
