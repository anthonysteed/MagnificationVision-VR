# TO-DO:

* bring up menu/checklist of items on left trigger click (trigger release --> menu disappears)
* make objects sparkle/disappear when gazed at for >2 sec
* implement standard SteamVR teleport

* improve gaze teleport:
	* set teleportation such that appearing inside objects is impossible (teleport some epsilon away from collider)
	* do not allow teleporting to above-eye heights
	* add visual indication to dot of valid/invalid teleportation spots
	* add progress bar to dot to indicate pending teleport
	
	
* prepare scene:
	* ensure all objects have colliders
	* 
	
	
	
## THINGS TO LOG:
* whether object was found though magRect or with direct unaided gaze
