# TO-DO:

* render gaze dot with 30-frame sampled average, but create a second moving average of distance multipliers
 (so magnification slowly converges to current gaze distance)
* augment mag camera rotation with gaze rotation (play around with how much)
* teleportation to dot position with button click/hold

* stretch: activate mag glass only if hands align
